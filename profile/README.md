# Need Support?

Thanks for building with Brale. We’re here to help.

As a stablecoin issuer and supporter of the broader ecosystem, we prioritize clear, complete, and public documentation. If our docs don’t address your issue, we’ll update them — so the next developer in your position has a better experience.

We strongly prefer **public GitHub issues** over DMs or private messages. Public communication helps us support more people, improve faster, and stay transparent.

## Step 1: Check the Docs

Start here:

- [Brale API Docs](https://docs.brale.xyz) – Full API reference and integration guides  
- [Commons (GitHub)](https://github.com/Brale-xyz/commons) – Open source assets, formats, and utilities  

---

## Step 2: Create an Issue or Reach Out

If your issue isn’t covered, [open a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/Brale-xyz/commons/issues/new). We’ll respond as quickly as we can — and others benefit from it being public.

If synchronous communication makes sense, we may invite you to a dedicated Slack thread.

If you're already in Slack, ask your account rep to add you to the relevant channels:
- `#brale-build` (core infrastructure & integration support)
- `#brale-app-dev` (application development support)

To start that process, email [help@brale.xyz](mailto:help@brale.xyz) with:
- A link to your GitHub issue  
- The email(s) you'd like us to invite
